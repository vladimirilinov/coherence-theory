# Coherence: Reality’s Core Algorithm

## Claim
Everything in reality emerges from a single evolutionary process: **Coherence**. Assume this process and you can derive and unify spacetime (GR), quantum mechanics, and the Standard Model from first principles.

## The Law of Coherence (elegant form)
A* = arg max_A [ inf_p Hold(Π_A, K_{A,p} Π_A) − λ_fuel B_fuel(A) − λ_cpx B_cpx(A) − λ_leak B_leak(A) ]

### Plain read
Pick the pattern that still works after every shove, charging it for fuel, complexity, and leakage. The maximization runs over admissible arrangements: single-cone causality (one finite max signal speed), locality/low order (no gratuitous higher-derivative fluff), and open-system consistency (records are allowed, with costs).

## Pokes
Interfaces with neighbors. Pokes alter observables; only pre vs post matters: compare Π_A to K_{A,p} Π_A. Content-agnostic; effect is what’s measured.

## Budgets (why exactly these three)
- **Fuel (throughput/energy):** nothing runs for free.
- **Complexity (moving parts/derivatives/dependencies):** overfitting and higher-order baggage are taxed; the Γ-limit favors the simplest stable law.
- **Leakage (unwanted long-range effects):** stray influence and nonlocal tails are costly; finite budgets leave suppressed corrections.

Patterns that survive pokes at minimal total cost persist. Others are used as fuel.

## What necessarily follows
- **Lorentzian spacetime (the arena):** One signal cone ⇒ Lorentzian metric.
- **Einstein’s law (the backbone):** Γ-convergence ⇒ Einstein–Hilbert; higher terms suppressed.
- **Quantum update (records and collapse):** Collapse is a priced edit via GKSL.
- **Gauge + matter (signals and locks):** Hypercharge fixed; three families selected.
- **Big Bang as coherence nucleation:** Expansion begins when R_coh > 1.
- **Dark matter as frozen leakage domains:** Behaves as long-lived gravitational matter.
- **Dark energy as persistent leakage freeze:** Appears as cosmological constant w≈−1.

## Predictions (pay-or-falsify)
- **Gravitational-wave phasing:** residuals ~10^-3 at LVK frequencies.
- **Black-hole shadows:** <5% ellipticity at EHT.
- **Cosmology:** H0 uplift ~2–3 km/s/Mpc.
- **Hawking flux:** ΔF/F ≈ −(0.01±0.004)Φ(ω/κ).
- **Dark matter:** effective w∈[0,0.1].
- **Dark energy:** w=−1 within bounds.

## Implications (mysteries, clarified)
- GR vs QM don’t mesh: they are regimes of one law.
- Cosmology tensions: O(ε^η) corrections integrate over history.
- Constants are duals: couplings are budget multipliers.
- Principled BSM filter: new physics must lower cost.

## Falsifiers (clean exit ramps)
- Superluminal modes or non-tensor GW polarizations.
- Large higher-derivative effects.
- Inconsistent (ε,η) across GW/EHT/PTA/cosmology.

## Closing
Assume coherence, pay every bill, and the world compresses to the simplest pattern that still carries cause-and-effect—our spacetime with Einstein’s backbone, quantum’s editor, and gauge-locked signals, plus tiny, priced cracks we can now measure.
